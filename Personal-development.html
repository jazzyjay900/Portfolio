          <span class="goals">Achive Your Goals:</span><br>
          <span class="goal-body">This chapter speaks about setting long term goals that’ll take about 10 years to complete<br> then midterm goals that’ll take about ½ the time as the long-term goal, also set short term goals that<br> takes about 1-2 years to complete and finally set micro goals that takes a few months to complete. Each <br>goal you set should lead you in the direction of your main long-term goal. This is sound advice I could use to<br> break my life goal up into easier smaller goals that would also help with the perception of my goal because they<br> become smaller seemingly easier goals I can achieve while working toward my main goal. My main goal in life is to have financial freedom,<br> and to get there I've set my midterm goal to earn my degree in computer science with short term goals of making steady improvements<br> to my gpa year after year.</span><br><br>
          <span class="time">The Proper Use Of Time:</span><br>
          <span class="time-body">
            This chapter state that you should make time serve you, spend your day going towards what’s important rather than towards<br> what is urgent. Live your life going for your dreams because although it’ll be hard, the pain of discipline stings a lot less<br> than the pain of regret and I could use the book as an example of how I can use time properly as it regards to my goals and how I<br> want my life to play out And so far I've been using my time to gain skills that’ll make achieving my main goal in life easier, such as: front-end coding(HTML & CSS) and back-end coding (Java script & OOP).

          <span class="people">Surround yourself With The Best People:</span><br>
          <span class="people-body">
            You should surround yourself with people who will bring out the best in you. You are influenced by the friends you keep<br> so having disciplined people in your corner can influence you in a way to make you disciplined as well. Life is hard and making<br> the decision to disassociate with long time friends can be hard but you have to make tough decisions when it comes to your future.<br>I’ve been thinking of this already but this book has showed me that the hard decisions need to be made to cut people out my life who hold me back for achieving my goal because when I’m on my deathbed they aren’t the ones who will have to deal with my regrets

          <span class="learn">Be a Life-long Learner:</span><br>
          <span class="learn-body">
            Formal education will make you a living, but self-education is the key to having a good life. As you go through life you should be willing to learn and change and adapt. The more you learn the better you will be and the closer you will get to living the life you want to. Reading is a great way to start learning from people who are already successful, thou it may come with a price tag, the important thing isn’t how much the book costs, but how much it will cost you if you don’t read it. I don’t like to read but while reading this chapter I realized that everyone who is successful says the same thing, that they read books to learn, so if I want to be a life long learner I’ll have to start reading more from people who have already become successful.
