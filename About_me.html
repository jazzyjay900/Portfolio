            <p>
              Hello, I was born in Black River St.Elizabth Jamaica and I grew up<br> in Leeds of the same parish. I was a very energetic kid growing up<br> which lead to me getting in trouble with my mother very often. I attended Mt. Osborn Primary in my youth before graduating to attent St.Elizabth Technical High School (S.T.E.T.H.S) It wasn't easy growing up because <br>we didnt have alot of money so life became really hard really fast but I kept going with the encouragement from my family until I made it to university where I am pursuing my bachelors in computer science to hopefully become a web Developer for a massive tech company (or start my own)
